//would you use regexes for this?
//well it seems like there are rules, like split after first consonant, so might be useful to just
//parse it manually. regex might work too, but not sure without knowing all rules.
//
//
//this is where I'm a bit tangled up. 
//basically there are more rules, and you have to go over the words recursively it seems,
//at least keep iterating over each syllable, because the syllable divisions happen in stages
//
//unfortunately some of the divisions require for you to look at the actual character symbol,
//not just if it is a vowel or consonant
//
//should I go over the additional rules, or should we start here? let's start here. also it might
//be possible to get rules in array in order of preference, like:
//[ C1VCVC, C1VC, VC] and iteratively try each one, if fits, use it.
//ok. I can show you also the script that this is loosely based on, would that be helpful? yep
//
//
//
//I'm on pretty low sleep here, just want to make sure I'm not giving wrong info.
//these above are correct
//
//
//does this make any sense? well a bit, but i don't get why CV1C -> CV1C but VCCV1C -> VCC, maybe a typo 
//one sec sorry I was applying the next rule. 
//does that look a bit better? well a bit, one more:
//VCCC1VCVC is VC, CC1VCV
//not sure about this... basically if there are three consonants in a row,
//you split after the first, does that make sens C
//yes, more or less, let's get to code
//
//
