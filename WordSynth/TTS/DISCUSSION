ok so problems are solved now, that's good

basically I want to integrate the API with this python lib http://web.mit.edu/music21/
to load in midi, and be able to map the midi to the syllables etc, as the next step

should I make a class called MusicMapper or something like that? yeah
ok and it takes word as an argument? yes


so classes that use the Word class do not need to be stored within the Word directory? right ok cool
great I can work on that. Thanks a lot for the help no problems
I can send you a payment again soon. Talk to you soon
